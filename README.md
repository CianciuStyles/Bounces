# Bounces
A simple Pygame project with bouncing balls.

The inspiration from this project came from an older version of KMPlayer (http://www.kmplayer.com/) in which, if you did not have any file in play, an animation with bouncing balls was displayed onto the screen. I just wanted to know if I was able to replicate such a nice effect :)

### Dependencies
* Pygame (http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
